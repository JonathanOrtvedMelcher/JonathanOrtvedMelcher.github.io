Jonathan Ortved Melcher is a PhD student in physics at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, dedicated to advancing climate research through the application of machine learning methods. His research focuses on using deep learning techniques to identify and analyze patterns in climate data, with particular emphasis on understanding atmospheric dynamics and their impacts on regional climate variability. This work is part of the ArcticPush project, which investigates Arctic-European climate teleconnections and their role in extreme weather events.
